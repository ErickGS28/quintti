# Quintti

A shared treasury for residential buildings, with the assembly's rules built into the account. Built on Stellar and Soroban.

> **Status:** hackathon prototype for Código Cordillera (BAF × Stellar). Documentation stage: this repository currently holds the product and architecture documents. Testnet only, unaudited, not for real funds.

## The problem

In most residential buildings, owners pay a monthly fee into an account they cannot inspect. One person, the administrator, decides how it is spent. The budget the assembly approves is a recommendation, invoices arrive weeks later as a PDF or a spreadsheet, and when the administrator changes, the history is lost. The money belongs to everyone, but control belongs to very few.

## What Quintti does

Quintti moves the assembly's rules into the account itself:

- **Budget limits per category.** The assembly loads the approved budget (maintenance, security, cleaning, contingencies). A payment that would exceed a category's limit is rejected by the contract.
- **Approved vendors only.** Money can only go to vendors the assembly has approved.
- **Council approval.** The administrator proposes an expense with its invoice. A threshold of council members (for example 2 of 3) must approve before the payment leaves.
- **Public receipts.** Every proposal, approval and payment is recorded. Any resident opens a read-only page and sees the balance, the budget against what has been spent, and who approved each payment, with no account needed.
- **History belongs to the building.** When the administrator or the council changes, the history stays.

The goal is to replace "trust me" with "see for yourself".

## Scope of this prototype

The prototype focuses on **how money leaves** the account. Collecting fees in local currency, and verifying that an invoice reflects a real expense, are out of scope and are described in [docs/05-risks-and-limits.md](docs/05-risks-and-limits.md).

## Planned repository layout

```
docs/          product, design and architecture documents
contracts/     Soroban treasury contract (Rust)
frontend/      web app (Next.js, TypeScript)
scripts/       deployment and demo data
```

Only `docs/` exists today. The other folders are added as they are built, and this README is updated with run instructions when they exist.

## Name

Quintti comes from the Quechua *qinti*, hummingbird: small, fast and precise. See [docs/decisions/0001-name.md](docs/decisions/0001-name.md).
